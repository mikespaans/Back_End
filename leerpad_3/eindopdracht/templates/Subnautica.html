<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<p>Subnautica is a survival action-adventure game set in an open world environment and played from a first-person
    perspective. The player controls the lone survivor of the Aurora, Ryley Robinson, as he is stranded on a remote
    ocean
    planet known as 4546B.

    The main objective is to explore the ocean and survive its dangers, while completing tasks to advance the plot.
    Players
    can collect resources, construct tools, build bases, submersibles, and interact with the planet's wildlife.

    Some of the most extreme dangers to the player include dangerous fauna like Crabsquids, Stalkers, Crashfish, and
    Leviathan-class lifeforms like the Reaper, Sea Dragon and Ghost Leviathans.

    The majority of the game is set underwater, with two explorable islands hidden across the map, and a simulated
    day-and-night cycle that affects visibility. Upon beginning a new game, players are given an option between four
    difficulty modes:

    In survival mode, the player manages their depleting health, hunger, thirst and oxygen. If the player dies, they
    respawn, but certain items are removed from their inventory.
    In freedom mode, gameplay is near-identical to that of survival mode, but without hunger and thirst.
    In hardcore mode, gameplay includes permanent death. If the player dies, they do not respawn, and their save file is
    instead permanently deleted.
    In creative mode, all depleting characteristics, such as health and thirst, are removed, all blueprints are
    unlocked,
    and the player can craft without needing resources. Additionally, the submersibles, a stasis rifle, a Seaglide, a
    mobile
    vehicle bay, and a propulsion cannon are provided, which do not need an energy source to operate.
    The game supports VR headsets, such as the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift, with the additional input of a keyboard and
    mouse or game controller.</p>


<h2>Plot</h2>
<p>Subnautica takes place in a distant spacefaring future. The Aurora, a deep-space vessel constructed by the Alterra
    Corporation, has been sent to a system at the outer reaches of known space on its maiden voyage under the pretenses
    of
    constructing high-speed space travel infrastructure. Unknown to the crew is that the ship was also sent to the
    system to
    search for and, possibly, rescue the crew of a ship named the Degasi, which crashed on planet 4546B ten years prior.
    As
    the Aurora does a gravity slingshot around 4546B, it is attacked by a mysterious energy-pulse and crashes on the
    planet.
    Several crew members manage to eject from the ship in escape pods, but only the player character—non-essential
    systems
    maintenance chief Ryley Robinson—survives.

    During this time, Ryley repairs the radio in his lifepod and gets messages through it from a trading ship called
    Sunbeam, led by Captain Avery Quinn. Quinn talks to Ryley and states that Sunbeam is on the far side of Andromeda
    but
    promises to take Ryley home, telling him that they will pick him up upon landing on a location Mountain Island. As
    the
    Sunbeam flies down, a giant alien facility fires upon it and it explodes in mid-air as Ryley watches. If the player
    manages to disable the facility before the Sunbeam lands, Quinn tells Ryley they are unable to land due to a debris
    field and will instead inform Alterra Corporation of the situation.

    Ryley finds records of the Degasi's crew stating that only three survived the initial crash, but later two out of
    the
    three are confirmed dead and one is presumed dead. Ryley also learns of the existence of the 'Precursors', an
    ancient,
    advanced alien species that came to planet 4546B approximately one thousand years ago in search of a cure for a
    highly
    infectious disease, known as the Kharaa Bacterium. The Precursors discovered Kharaa during the exploration of an
    unknown
    planet, and the disease spread due to a failure in quarantine procedures, killing over 140 billion individuals.
    Investigating thousands of planets in an attempt to find a cure, the Precursors eventually located a species of
    organism
    on 4546B they named the Sea Emperor Leviathan, which produced an enzyme that could cure Kharaa. However, the only
    living
    Sea Emperor was too old to produce the enzyme in enough potency to have any effect, and the Precursors were unable
    to
    force its only eggs to hatch. In an attempt to investigate the egg-hatching process of the Sea Emperor, the
    Precursors
    took the egg of a related Leviathan, the fire-breathing Sea Dragon, but the mother destroyed a Precursor research
    facility and released samples of Kharaa into the planet's ecosystem. Forced to evacuate, the Precursors enabled a
    facility known as the Quarantine Enforcement Platform, which consists of a large weapon that fires on any ships
    attempting to leave or land on the planet — including the Degasi, Aurora and Sunbeam.

    The Sea Emperor, which seeks the freedom of her children, communicates telepathically with Ryley and helps him
    discover
    the prison in which she is held captive. She gives Ryley information on how to hatch her eggs, who does so and is
    cured
    by the enzyme produced by the juvenile Sea Emperors. Ryley then disables the Quarantine Enforcement Platform (only
    achievable by one not infected with Kharaa) and constructs a rocket with blueprints transmitted by Alterra
    Corporation
    to the crashed Aurora. After escaping the planet, the Sea Emperor communicates with Ryley a final time, promising
    that
    the two "go together" although they are different</p>
